This demo features an OpenLayers map showing vector features coming from a
remote TinyOWS server. Only a portion of the features is fetched depending on
the zoom level currently on. Also, the label text and color displayed is
controlled by a custom switcher on the right. The javascript code was
minimized using the YUI Compressor tool.
