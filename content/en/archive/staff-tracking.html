This webmapping application was built and used to monitor staff of outdoor
events, such as concerts and shows, on an interactive map. It was designed to
be used in a standard browser and tablets.

Zones and staff icons are displayed on the map and refreshed every 15 seconds,
mimicking what it could look like when used during a real event.

The client-side application uses OpenLayers, GeoExt and ExtJS as JavaScript
frameworks. The base maps was created using MapServer Basemaps and Imposm using
OpenStreetMap data and is published using the OGC TMS protocol with a MapCache
server. The features are obtained using the OGC WFS protocol, with MapServer
and come from a PostGIS database. 

The demo itself contains a "About this demo" button, which contains more
information and technical details.
