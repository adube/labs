## Challenge Description

[MRB & Associates][mrb] is a company that operates in the mining industry,
specifically in exploration data management. The company
wants to offer its customers new ways of browsing their data without
changing their existing web services. All via a simple and intuitive
web interface.

Among the desired features:

-   Display a shapefile (ex. public claims) quickly in a web interface
-   Data analysis with a simple query tool
-   Publishing of those claims as KML or as a web service
-   Integrating open data ([SIGEOM][sigeom]) and automatic updates coming
    from [GESTIM][gestim]


## Production

The challenge was divided into two parts: the creation of maps using
geospatial data and the creation of a web mapping interface in which
they're loaded.

### The Maps

Duchaine Simon led the production of maps using
[MapServer][mapserver] and [ScribeUI][scribeui] software, which
allowed fast and efficient data management to produce images of maps
available for the web interface.

### The Web Interface

Julien-Samuel Lacroix created the web interface using
[ExtJS 4][extjs] and mapping components using [GeoExt 2][geoext2] and
[OpenLayers 2.12][openlayers]. The [MVC][MVC] architecture natively
supported in ExtJS has been used to properly manage the components of
the application and also allowed it to be compressed into a single
JavaScript file for optimal performance.


## What is the Geohack

</a>

The [GeoHack Challenge of Montreal 2013][defigeohackmtl] is an
hackathon derivative event held around
[Geomatics Conference 2013][geomatique2013] that took place in
October 2, 2013. Participants included developers in the field of
geomatics and business people from different companies and organizations
that acted as "Ordering Customers" for subjects suggested.

Each team was composed of one coordinator representing the "client"
and up to three developers. Together, they had the challenge of producing
a web mapping application in a single day. These had to be published
under a free license for the benefit of the geographical heritage and
open data of the Quebec community.

more about the various projects that have been realized ​​during the event.
