## Demo goal and origin

The goal of this demo is to show the attractions of a city using various
navigation methods from using an [OpenStreetMap][osm] map and a contextual
information list. We borrowed a [Mapbox tutorial][mapbox] to make this demo
using [Leaflet][leaflet].

## Features

There are several possible ways to obtain the information:

*   Scroll the left list of points of interests down using the mouse or
    keyboard
*   Click on a point of interest on the list or on the map

In the "Maison Horace-Bouffard" description, we also added a link to get
the directions from the tourist information office in Matane to that location.

We also added a link on the top of the list that displays a slideshow
of pictures dynamically obtained from Flickr using their geolocation and a
"matane" search tag.
