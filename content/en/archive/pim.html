This demo features an OpenLayers map showing vector features coming from a
remote server, which are clustered on client-side when too close to each other.
A click on a feature shows a popup with aggregated information if it contains
clusters, or a complete detail if it only contains one.

The base maps come directly from OpenStreetMap server. The features are obtained
using the OGC WFS protocol, with MapServer.
