A webmapping application made by the Mapgears Quebec team.

The webmapping engine used is Leaflet. The application also uses jQuery and D3
for HTML manipulation and for the various animations purposes.

The base map is published by a MapCache service using the OGC TMS protocol. The
vector features on the map containing the investment informations come from the
Open Data of the Quebec Government.

For more details, see the on-line application.
