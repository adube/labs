This webmapping application shows three different ways to visualize geospatial
data: in an interactive map, in a spreadsheet-like grid and and charts, such
as pie and column charts.

The client-side application uses OpenLayers 2.12, GeoExt 2.0 and ExtJS 4.1.0 as
JavaScript frameworks. The base maps was built using OpenStreetMap data and is
published using the OGC TMS protocol with a MapCache server. The features are
obtained using the OGC WFS protocol, with MapServer.

The demo itself shows an "About this application" window upon visiting it,
which contains more information and technical details.
